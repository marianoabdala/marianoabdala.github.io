  Ideas begin on paper.


An awesome app, worth buying a stylus.

I like the way they used the pinch to bring up the menu. I did something similar on Square war.

The only aspect I’m not sure about is the fact that they sell1 different tools:

Draw (included)
Sketch (1.99 USD)
Outline (1.99 USD)
Write (1.99 USD)
Color (1.99 USD) and,
Essesntials (Draw, Sketch, Outline, Write and Color for 7.99 USD).
So buying them independently costs 7.96 USD but all together they cost 7.99 USD, I’m sure they (or I) missed something here…



A. The way they sell them is just classy. You can try each one before buying, and the examples give a clear view of what you may achieve with it. ↩
