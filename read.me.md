If you are reading this it is very likely that we are or will be collaborating in one way or another in building **something awesome**. Maybe we are launching an app soon or taking an existing one to the next level. We may be putting together a talk about an app, a new programming language or framework, or more generally just how to work better. We may be discussing the software development processes, or how to better hire or coach developers. We may even be collaborating on going deep on a feature to make it super easy or pleasing to use. You may very well be a software developer or architect, an engineering manager, a product designer, a business analyst or a product owner. My hope is that this intro will help in speeding up how we communicate and thus help us in achieving our shared goals more effectively.

If you have one like this or similar please let me know. **I'd love to read it!**

# About

I've been building software professionally for the last couple decades. I had my share of success and my share of failure too, I'd like to think I've learnt from both. Thought I consider myself a generalist, having spent time helping in most roles you can think of when it comes to building software, I specialised in _mobile_ development for the last half of my career.

I think mobile is where –due to the inherent restrictions of the environment– we need to push ourselves further. There's no room for 20 options in one screen, there's no room for system that requires a user manual, there's no room for just adding hardware to fix performance issues. Asking the user for an extra tap to achieve something can **make or break an entire business** when it comes to mobile.

During this last half of my career, too, I worked _independently_ as a contractor for multiple companies, mostly startups located in the US, Canada and Europe. I'm only just now starting to work for a [well-stablished company](https://www.globant.com/) in my [home country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina).

I've founded both the [NSCoder Buenos Aires](https://nscoderba.tumblr.com) and the [NSConf Argentina](http://nsconfarg.com), at that time the most important and longer standing iOS meetup and conference in Argentina. I decided on passing on the [organisation of the NSCoder](https://mariano.zerously.com/post/66670579060/hosting-an-nscoder) to good friends and earliest members, and to [conclude the NSConf altogether](http://zerously.com/2019/10/13/nsconf-arg-end.html) after incredible runs.

# How to

# Things I value

#### Clear ownership
If you hear me say that you are responsible for something, you truly are. In its entirety. It's your project, your mission, and as such I expect you to keep me updated on its status. If I don't hear from your I'll assume things are going great and on time. You can rely on me for advice and resources, but I'm counting on you to deliver. I may refer to you as the "[DRI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/10/02/how-well-does-apples-directly-responsible-individual-dri-model-work-in-practice/#c858327194c4)" of the task at hand.

#### Honesty and openness
No, seriously. I **will** give you [immediate and candid feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-Tcr0T9Tyw). I hope you will understand where this comes from –I'm trying to **help you**– and that you will do the same for me.

#### Care for whatever we are building
Be it an app, a demo, a process documentation, a JIRA board. I like to be able to tell there was care poured into it.

#### Async communication
I've spent some of the 2000's and most of the 2010's working remotely. I managed to go all that time without tapping anyone on the shoulder. Please ask yourself, may I be interrupting a long thought process that may take a while to put together? Do I really need this _right now_ or can it wait a few minutes or even hours?

I'll typically respond to:  
**Emails in 2 to 4 hours.** If you tag it as Important or if you give me a clear deadline, I'll likely be able to make it happen.  
**IMs in 10 minutes to 1 hour.** I prefer Slack, Hangouts is OK, Whatsapp is kinda personal, so please make it your last option.  
**Phone calls immediately...** but rudely if I realise an email or an IM would've done it.  
**Taps on the shoulder immediately...** but rudely if I realise an email or an IM would've done it.

Typically, wearing headphones, sketching on my notepad or typing furiously means I'm in [the zone](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/a-nerd-in-a-cave/).

#### Taking notes.
I've got a terrible memory and a ton of different issues that I need to follow up. This is not going into your _permanent record_. I'm not going to quote you later. Just trying to keep my facts straight. Sometimes, I'll be even just writing down questions to ask later in an effort to avoid interrupting you.

A lot of how I work was influenced by my experience and some reading. While my experience isn't _linkable_, some of my reading is! If you want to better understand why I do what I do you may want to take a look at the following:
