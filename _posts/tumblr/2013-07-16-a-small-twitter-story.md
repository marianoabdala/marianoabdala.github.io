Dave Verwer posts an article of mine on iOSDevWeekly 1.
Andrey Subbotin tweets about it 2.
Dave Mark RTs it 3.
The Akosma RTs it, and starts following me 4.
I follow The Akosma and respond to one of his tweets 5.
Gugote, who knows us both, asks us if we know each other 6.

Next day:
Dave Addey asks for URL Schema lists 7.
Guido Hendricks replies with an article from The Akosma 8.
Dave Addey RTs it 9.
Julio Carrettoni, whom I know, RTs it 10.
I see it, and start freaking out (Sorry, no link).

The world, indeed, is very small.
