I have one of these

He’s dumb enough as to jump off the roof.


So I bought some of this,


About a hundred of these,


To keep him from ending there.


I made sure every corner was covered.

But I ended up with a lot of remainders…

So I did this,


With a bit of this, to add stability


In order to support this.


This is the final result,


For a happy desk. :-)
