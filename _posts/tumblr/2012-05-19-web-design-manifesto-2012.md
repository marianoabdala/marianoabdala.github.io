WEB DESIGN MANIFESTO 2012Jeffery Zeldman on his blog redesing:


  Many people who’ve visited this site since the redesign have commented on the big type. It’s hard to miss. After all, words are practically the only feature I haven’t removed.


Great intro to my blog redesign.

The main idea behind the big type for me is to allow readers to stay on the site to read instead of sending it to Instapaper.
