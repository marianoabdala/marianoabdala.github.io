Useless mugMarco Arment can clearly do more than just coding… Who wouldn’t love to have a mug like this?



It says:


  Useless ★☆☆☆☆

  Can’t believe I wasted money on this crap. I use this mug every day and want to rate it 5 stars but it still doesn’t support Google Buzz. Emailed the developers 5 times already! Will update this review once they add it.

Genius!

I had IdiotAppReviews recommended not long ago by Dan Byler. If you are a developer and sometimes get frustrated because of senseless bad reviews, this might pour some humor over them.
