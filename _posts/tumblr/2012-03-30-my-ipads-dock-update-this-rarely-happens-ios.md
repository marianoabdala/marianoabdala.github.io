My iPad’s dock update

This rarely happens. iOS users get to choose just 6 out of many apps to remain available for easy access on all pages of the home, also known as “in the dock”.

Paper motivated this1, now I keep Twitter, Mail, Safari, Paper, Instapaper and iBooks.

Naming coincidence: Paper and Instapaper.
