One of capitalismâ€™s greatest fallacies is that making money is a purpose in itself and that the need for money is such a motivation that without it all business related activities would come to a stop.

We now have the chance of watching a company with absolutely no need for money.

Watch Apple closely and see if the lack of need for money deprives them of a purpose or if it stops them.
