Productivity strikes not always hit you in the middle of the day. If one hits at night and you want to make the most out of it, you have to be prepared.

Most screens are simply not designed or tuned for looking good at night1, this has quite a negative effect, specially if you need to go through thousands of lines of code, as most programmers do. Of course you could adjust its brightness but still, the color temperature of your house’s light is not the same as the color temperature of the light emitted by the sun and the results are obvious.

I found many applications that try to deal with this issue, but the one that suited me better is f.lux. It just works and it’s free! You can set it to automatically turn on based on your location to ensure super accurate transition form day to night.



I also tried other similar products, but they wouldn’t integrate so well with swapping spaces, showing the desktop, mission control and similar.



Or ever be healthy to look at for long. ↩
