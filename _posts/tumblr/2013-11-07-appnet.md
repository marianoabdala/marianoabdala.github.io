When App.net was first introduced to the world I refused to sign in. The premise that because it was paid it was good was plain wrong.

On the other hand, I’m quite active in twitter and have great followers. I don’t have thousands of followers but a few of iOS’s most known names actually follow me, and I’m quite proud of it. Why would I want to leave?

The problem is that I have most of my closest friends on twitter too and I hate bugging my technology, english speaking followers with pictures of the “empanadas”1 I had last night near Palermo, local politics or 9gag stuff.

So I finally signed in on App.net and started posting only iOS related stuff in there. It’s a bit like LinkedIn without the recruiters, it’s great.
Now guys, would you follow me on App.net?



Empanadas are so good. You should try them some time. ↩
