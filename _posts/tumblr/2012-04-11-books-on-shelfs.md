For the first time I paid for an eBook1.

As with many online bookstores, you could order the paperback to be shipped to your house, or download the eBook or both (typically bundled-priced).

—It’s not as cheap as the eBook, but I’d love to have this book on my bookshelf — I thought, and suddenly, the image of a deer on a wall came to me.

So, how long before we start seeing books on shelfs as dead trees and shipping pollution?
