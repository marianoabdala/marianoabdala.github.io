If you are reading this it is very likely that we are or will be collaborating in one way or another in building **something awesome**. Maybe we are launching an app soon or taking an existing one to the next level. We may be putting together a talk about an app, a new programming language or framework, or more generally just how to work better. We may be discussing the software development processes, or how to better hire or coach developers. We may even be collaborating on going deep on a feature to make it super easy or pleasing to use. You may very well be a software developer or architect, an engineering manager, a product designer, a business analyst or a product owner. My hope is that this intro will help in speeding up how we communicate and thus help us in achieving our shared goals more effectively.

If you have one like this or similar please let me know. **I'd love to read it!**

# About

I've been building software professionally for the last couple decades. I had my share of success and my share of failure too, I'd like to think I've learnt from both. Thought I consider myself a generalist, having spent time helping in most roles you can think of when it comes to building software, I specialised in _mobile_ development for the last half of my career.

I think mobile is where –due to the inherent restrictions of the environment– we need to push ourselves further. There's no room for 20 options in one screen, there's no room for system that requires a user manual, there's no room for just adding hardware to fix performance issues. Asking the user for an extra tap to achieve something can **make or break an entire business** when it comes to mobile.

During this last half of my carrer, too, I worked _independently_ as a contractor for multiple companies, mostly startups located in the US, Canada and Europe. I'm only just now starting to work for a [well-stablished company](https://www.globant.com/) in my [home country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina).

I've founded both the [NSCoder Buenos Aires](https://nscoderba.tumblr.com) and the [NSConf Argentina](http://nsconfarg.com), at that time the most important and longer standing iOS meetup and conference in Argentina. I decided on passing on the [organisation of the NSCoder](https://mariano.zerously.com/post/66670579060/hosting-an-nscoder) to good friends and earliest members, and to [conclude the NSConf altogether](http://zerously.com/2019/10/13/nsconf-arg-end.html) after incredible runs.
