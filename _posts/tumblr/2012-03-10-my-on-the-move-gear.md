I’m a semi-independent 1 iOS developer, and as such I’m lucky enough as to be able to choose where to work from on a day-by-day basis. Wait, wait! Don’t worry, this is not a post about grabbing your laptop and going to live in some exotic country, it’s much more humble.

This post is about what I consider to be must haves for a coding day out. Coincidently it’s what I carry on my backpack right now…
Backpack, I carry a Nike 90, but it’s not specially good
MacbookPro 13" Core2Duo @2.66Ghz with 4Gb RAM
Incase Canvas Sleeve, for the MBP
A black simple 3 ½" x 5 ½" notebook 2, that happens to be Moleskine.
Three Stabilo 68 pens (green, blue and black) and an HB Staedtler pencil, with an eraser on the back.
Hand sanitizer, public transportation has many advantages, higene is not one of them.
Two band-aids. 3The equivalent to three bus/metros rides in coins.
Headphones… particularly useful if you go to Starbucks 
and it’s christmas time.
No battery charger 4, no phone charger, no 30 pin connector, no DVI-to-VGA converter, no magic mouse, no wireless keyboard… they all stay at home.


I also carry, within my Macbook, a piece of obsolete -almost a pound in weight- technology: the DVD-ROM. God I hate it! I’d say it’s the only thing I carry I don’t need. 5

Probably what I like the most about getting my backpack ready and leave home is the feeling that I don’t need a ton of things to do a great job.



I’m going to a post about this later. ↩



For which I offer 50 usd in reward if lost & found. ↩



In case I get awfully wounded and need to code for my life. ↩



I usually can code and listen to music from 9 to 5 on a single battery charge. ↩



Actually it really amazes me that Apple’s top of the line portable computer still includes a device that reads from a spinning piece of metal with wholes in it. ↩
