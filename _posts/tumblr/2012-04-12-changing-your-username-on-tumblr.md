So you created a blog on tumblr just for fun, started getting linked and later realized that you want to change the title or the url?

You could, but you’d be loosing all those links that point out to you… unless you follow these 12 easy steps:

Note: Let’s say your blog’s old name is old-tumblrname and you want to change it to new-tumblrname.

Go to tumblr’s dashboard
Click the “old-tumblrname” blog on top
Click “Blog settings”
Change the URL to http://new-tumblrname.tumblr.com1
Click the + sign on top to create a new blog
Enter “Redirecting” as title, “old-tumblrname”.tumblr.com as domain and click “Create blog”
Click the “old-tumblrname” blog on top, the one you’ve just created, it should be to the right
Click “Customize theme”
Click “Edit HTML”
Replace the HTML with:
https://gist.github.com/marianoabdala/ba5528b4935b93b336c3

Watch tumblr freak out about it, don’t worry
Click the “Save” button.
Now all your previous links should redirect correcty and your username should be new-tumblrname, just like you wanted!

Thanks to Ignacio Iglesias for that lovely javascript.



Optionally, give it a custom domain name. ↩
