Money and the AppStoreEmeric Thoa:


  Eighteen months ago, when I left Ubisoft to start an independent game studio and focus on making my own games, I looked online a bit to get an idea of how much income I could expect to make as an indie.


Awesome analysis of a game developer that went indie on the App Store. As usual, most principles apply to any kind of app.

Anyone planning (or dreaming) to go indie would be making himself a favor by taking a look at it.

SPOILER: He didn’t get rich. This isn’t that kind of story.
