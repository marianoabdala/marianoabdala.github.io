Frighteningly ambitious startup ideasPaul Graham on startup ideas that might sound too ambitious:


  There’s a scene in Being John Malkovich where the nerdy hero encounters a very attractive, sophisticated woman. She says to him:
  
  
    Here’s the thing: If you ever got me, you wouldn’t have a clue what to do with me.
  
  
  That’s what these ideas say to us.


Later he shares seven that may work anyway:


  A New Search Engine
  Replace Email
  Replace Universities
  Internet Drama
  The Next Steve Jobs
  Bring Back Moore’s Law
  Ongoing Diagnosis
  

I’d add a real-time communication tool that doesn’t suck.

This would pretty much cover it:

Chat
Voice
Video
Screen sharing
Remote assistance
Share files at a practical speed1, accept small ones automatically
Search history2
Communicate with other clients and networks
Desktop, web and mobile availability
Reasonable3 amount of RAM consumed when idle
Easily set availability for chat, voice or video

All this should happen equally fast with one or many people at the time.


5kb/s won’t do. ↩



I mean the whole history, not just local. So, of course, store history on the cloud. ↩



100 Mb won’t do. ↩
