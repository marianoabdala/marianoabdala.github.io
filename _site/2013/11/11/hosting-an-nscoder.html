    <p>This coming December the 3rd I’ll be hosting the 17th NSCoder in the lovely city of Buenos Aires1, Argentina. It’ll be on that date that a year and a half ago I hosted the very first one.</p>

<p>I intend to list here the most important lessons I learnt from this experience and the factors that I think were key to its success (and survival).</p>

<p>Currently, the group is healthy and the effort that the hosting requires is minimal, most new members return and most members are quite active in the distribution list. We are meeting monthly with an average of 10 to 12 assistants.</p>

<p>Our member base is diverse: we have indies, full-timers and contractors; pros and amateurs; boys and girls; we, of course, have locals but also people from France, Spain and England; we even had people from nearby cities who had changed their trip plans to Buenos Aires just to attend the NSCoder2.What’s so great about attending an NSCoder?
I know my good share of iOS developers. The most common project for most of them is just one dev or maybe two, often scattered around the globe. We simply don’t get to know as many people in our industry from just showing up in the office as other people do.</p>

<p>NSCoders may vary a lot from one another, but if the group is hosted right, no matter what you do in the meetings (coding, keynotes, share experiences or just chat) you are going to meet people, a lot of them. If you enjoy following fellow iOS developers on Twitter try having a cup of coffee with them, it will blow your mind.</p>

<p>If there’s no NSCoder where you live you should definitely start and host one.</p>

<p>Here’s how I handled important aspects of starting and hosting an NSCoder myself. I hope you find them useful.Start by attending other NSCoders, if possible
It’ll give you a general sense of how NSCoders are supposed to be run and you’ll be able to learn from their hosts. Most likely, you’ll have a really good time.Create a profesional internet persona for you cities’ NSCoder
A Twitter account and a one page website are indispensable. Be sure to tweet only reminders or change in plans and keep your website brief and clear, lots of people don’t know what an NSCoder is and will be shy to attend. Set the mood.</p>

<p>Check NSCoder Buenos Aires’ twitter account and website for reference, they are in Spanish, but you’ll get the idea.Define location and scheduling
Convincing people to go to a place other than their houses after a hard day of work isn’t easy. The best location is then, between where most of the attendants work and live. Schedule meetings so that most people can leave their job and arrive into a just started meeting. Meetings of around two hours worked fine for us.</p>

<p>Try picking a venue where each person can arrive and leave when they want and pay their own check, not everyone will arrive and leave at the same time.Meet once a month, instead of once a week
Traditionally NSCoder Nights are held once a week. People will simply get tired of it. You need your members to mark the date in their calendars, make this event a priority. If they can skip this one and go to the one next week, they’ll skip it often.
Have a private distribution list for attendants only
This will help to keep the conversation going between meetings, it’ll provide with an easy channel for last minute changes or reminders and it’s a great resource in general.Always attend
Even if nobody confirmed assistance. Worst thing that could happen is that you’ll get a nice coffee or beer at a place you like. Whereas if you don’t attend the worst thing that could happen is that someone shows up and there’s nobody there. That someone will never return, and will probably trash you and the group publicly every time he can.</p>

<p>Showing up a bit early is not a bad idea.Don’t have an agenda or an organiser
Just have (be) a host that makes sure to remember and encourage people to attend. Once they’ve attended, allow them to do as they please.Invite new people
The best way of inviting someone is to start following him on Twitter, absolutely non intrusive. If they are into this sort of things you’ll get their attention with just a nice avatar3 and a bio like:</p>

<p>We are a bunch of iOS devs in the [your city] area that simply gather for a [coffee | beer] and [talk | code | demo]. Join us!Ask new members to introduce themselves
About half hour into the meeting ask new members to introduce themselves. Ask them to say who they are, what they’ve done (any apps we might have heard of?) and where they work at now. It’s a nice ice breaker for them and it will avoid some awkward situations.Invest in diversity
What’s the point in meeting lots of people if they all have had more or less the same experiences? Invest a few extra minutes in trying to convince indies, girls and foreigners to attend. You’ll get tons of local male contractors to attend anyway, don’t worry.Keep an updated list of members
Make it easy for members to follow each other up. Also, those who are not totally convinced to attend may already know or follow someone in the group, and decide to attend in order to meet them.Prohibit the attendance of recruiters
This is huge, be as explicit as you see fit. Several members told me that this was key to convince them to join.
Enjoy.
Special thanks to Jiva DeVoe, who, by hosting and inviting me to attend his NSCoder+Virtual, not only introduced me to the NSCoder world but also inspired me (among other things) to start one in my own city.</p>
