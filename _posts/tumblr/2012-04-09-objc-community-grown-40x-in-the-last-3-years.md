TIOBE Software releases a monthly Programming Community Index that shows the evolution of the online presence of different programming languages:


  The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. The popular search engines Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Wikipedia, Amazon, YouTube and Baidu are used to calculate the ratings. Observe that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.


This month ObjC surpassed 8% and is only below C, Java and C++. This is amazing if you consider that ObjC projects can contain C and C++ code in them.

When I started coding in late 2008, ObjC had ~0.2% presence… it was a hard time to find help, reference or documentation. We didn’t even have the Apple Developer Forums!

Post, baby post!
