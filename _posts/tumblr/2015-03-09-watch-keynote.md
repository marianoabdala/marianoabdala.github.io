As I said before 1, I purposely stayed out of Twitter during today’s Apple’s keynote. I didn’t wanted to contribute polluting with comments that had no elaboration or to be distracted from the keynote itself.

So here are my thoughts on the keynote. Later, I’ll review Twitter and then, if necessary, update.

Watch HBO NOW anywhere.2


  HBO NOW℠ is accessible only in the U.S. and certain U.S. territories where a high-speed broadband connection is available.


I hate not being able to get content due to my location, in this case, they are rubbing it in my face.

Research Kit


  One of the biggest challenges researchers have is recruiting, they often have to pay people to participate, which by the way, doesn’t give you the best cross-section of the population.


I really dislike the sound of that. In my head it translated immediately as “yuk, people so poor they’d subject themselves to health research for money”. Just awful.

Are iPhone and watches owners a better cross-section of the population? Absolutely not, but they are wealthier, and Apple’s customers.


  We wanted anybody, anywhere, regardless of the platform they are on to contribute, so we are actually going to make this open source


Which “this”? The Apps, the framework, the services? Only the services make sense as platform independent open source project, if any.

Macbook

Just not sure about the new side arrow keys being as tall as the up and down together3.

watch

Really caught my attention the fact that for the collection watch you could spend nearly as much on the band than in the watch itself4, 549 to 1099, “depending on the band selection”.
