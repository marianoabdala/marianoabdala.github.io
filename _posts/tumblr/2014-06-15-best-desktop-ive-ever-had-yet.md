After having shared a few pics on twitter or with my friends of my new desktop, a good number of them got interested and started asking for some specific details, some trying to build it themselves.
I wasn’t going to write a post about this one desk, but since it’s incredibly comfortable to me and people shown interest, I decided I’ll share the specs so anyone can build one.
I have to say I didn’t built this one myself and that it costed me a bit more than 150 U$S (see previous desktop).
Materials:
1- 1½" 2,000x800mm solid pine wood panel, with cables hole drilled.
4- 345x545mm wall brackets.
Cost: 
Wood panel and wall brackets: 2890 AR$ (~350 U$S)
Wood panel polish and lamination: 600 AR$ (~75 U$S)
Transportation and installation: 470 AR$ (~55 U$S)
Total: 3960 AR$ (~ 480 U$S)
Optionally you can add a chest of drawers, as I did. It’s proving to be really useful.
Finally, you can download the specs here, feel free to share them!
