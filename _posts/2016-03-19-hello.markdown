I know, I know. I shouldn't be switching my blog's url and name so often.

But Tumblr wasn't doing such a great job at hosting my posts... and I just decided I'd go lean with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), start over, hell, _why not_?

You can find my previous writings here:  
[mariano.zerously.com](http://mariano.zerously.com) (2013-2015)  
[mythirdblog](http://mythirdblog.wordpress.com) (2007-2010)

I tried importing them, redirecting them, renaming them and honestly, it just wasn't worth it.

I'll save you some time, here are my **favorite posts** from my past blogs:
