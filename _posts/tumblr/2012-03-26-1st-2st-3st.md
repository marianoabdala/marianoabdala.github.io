In case you haven’t heard of them, Texas Poker is a really popular app from Pokerist.com. At the time I’m writting this, they have 23.793 online users with 1.902 tournaments being played, they mean serious business and have a huge community.

I love this app, I’m a regular player. If you like playing Poker you have to try it!

They support iPhone, iPod, iPad, Android, OSX and Facebook and are well into the 3.0.2 version of the OSX app… Yet, I found this:





How on earth does something like this get through so many people without anyone noticing?!
