As with most software engineers, I worked for many companies during my career, specially in the begining, where I couldn’t find the right place to for me to work on1.

My LinkedIn profile was crowded with companies, positions, specialties, education degrees and a lot of other useless data. So I decided to apply a bit of what I use daily when developing iOS apps and focused on what might be important for the people I’d like to be hired by2 and what I value the most.

Here’s what my profile ended up having:

Recommendations, only for my current position.3
Positions, current and the previous one.
Education, university only.
Additional info, my company’s website and this blog.
If someone really wants to know more, he can send me a message and we’ll chat. Otherwise  showing the most relevant data only is better.

Now I feel like my profile is much more attractive for the right people. But, don’t take my word for it,  see for yourself, feel free to visit my profile to see how it looks like.



I finally realized the right place to work was working independently, which is not exactly a “place”. ↩



As opposed to 500+ connections HR persons. ↩



I’m lucky enough that I worked for incredibly generous people, willing to share with the world their experience working with me, helping me get more work. ↩
