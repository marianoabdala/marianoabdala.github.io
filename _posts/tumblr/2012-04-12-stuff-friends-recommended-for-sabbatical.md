A while ago I realized I needed to take a real break, a full stop after two years of frenetical iOS development. So I planned a sabbatical month, I was hoping to sort my thoughts, get back to my regular energy level and maybe get inspired with a great idea for an app I could build and sell myself.

In order to get inspired I figured the best strategy was to rest and feed my brain with new stuff, so I turned out to a reduced group of people asking them to recommend me1 one movie, one music album and one article.

Here’s what I got in response to that request…2

For some reason most people only recommended an album. ↩
