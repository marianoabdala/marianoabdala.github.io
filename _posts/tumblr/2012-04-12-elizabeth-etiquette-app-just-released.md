You can know much about a person’s attention to etiquette based on the way he writes code and vice versa1. I always try to improve both so it’s with great pleasure that I developed this app for the guys at BlueDoor apps, and now announce that it’s been released to the AppStore!

Elizabeth Etiquette has been around for quite a bit, helping people improve their etiquette. You can find more about them on their site or download the app on iTunes 2.

It has some very cool features like a trivia and an etiquette quotient calculator, to measure how much you know about etiquette, along with a few tutorials and access to their blog’s latests posts.

A few screenshots for you delight:
