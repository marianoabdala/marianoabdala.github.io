I noticed something changed on the way YouTube handles the lack of Flash. Not long ago if you didn’t have Flash installed on your browser and wanted to watch a video that wasn’t encoded to be streamed via HTML5 you’d get a “Update your flash version” or “Missing plug-in” message.

Now they simply say that it’s unavailable. I wonder why they’ve changed it. Sounds a lot to me like they gave up on Flash…

“Unavailable” video



Same “unavailable” video on a Flash capable browser
