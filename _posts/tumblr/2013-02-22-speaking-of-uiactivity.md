Continuing with the subject of creating a better UIActivity API, here’s a talk I gave just a week ago.

It was given in the context of iOSDevAr, kindly hosted by Wayra Argentina and, as such, it’s in spanish. I might add english subtitles at some point.





Feel free to download and share the slides.
